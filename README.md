# RedHat Satellite Dashboard

Hello,

if anyone still using the Satellite 5.x from RedHat, this might be interesting Dashboard I've created with Jam.py framework (https://github.com/jam-py/jam-py). 

It is reveling a lot of things not instantly seen on the Satellite Overview Tab. For example, we see how dispersed the RAM allocation is on our VmWare infrastructure.

Also, not easy to spot how many running kernels are in production, etc.

Please refeer to https://github.com/jam-py/jam-py/issues/53 for the actual files and how to. 

Enjoy
